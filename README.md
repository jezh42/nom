NOM: Cure your bad habit of mistyping (with food)
=======================================

NOM (NOM NOM NOM) runs across your terminal when you type "nom" as you meant to
type "npm". It's just a joke command, and not useful at all, except to make you
hungry.

Inspired by popular package *sl* by Toyoda Masashi
